NSX-T Federation Demo 1: Networking & Security | NSX-T offers the ability to manage and operate simply and centrally Network and Security services with NSX-T Federation. This is done with our new element: NSX-T Global Manager (GM). This first demo will drive you through GM UI where different stretched network and security are configured.| https://youtu.be/Dcx-0lvwvPs
NSX-T Federation Demo 2: Disaster Recovery |NSX-T offers the ability to manage and operate simply and centrally Network and Security services with NSX-T Federation. This is done with our new element: NSX-T Global Manager (GM). This second demo will drive you through Disaster Recovery (DR) use case where 1 Location is lost, and Network and Security services are simply recovered thanks to NSX-T.| https://youtu.be/kuVfCw1q5g8
VMware Cloud on AWS – Transit Connect Demo: SDDC to SDDC |The Transit Connect feature in VMware Cloud on AWS offers customers the ability to interconnect resources using a VMware managed Transit Gateway in a very simple and easy to use method. This first demonstration shows how to setup two SDDCs to use this feature. | https://youtu.be/UejYkwbTE9E
VVMware Cloud on AWS – Transit Connect Demo: SDDC to VPC |The Transit Connect feature in VMware Cloud on AWS offers customers the ability to interconnect resources using a VMware managed Transit Gateway in a very simple and easy to use method. This second demonstration shows how to setup a native AWS VPC to utilize this feature. | https://youtu.be/C9Ds9CL0yG8
VMwware Cloud on AWS – Multi Edge SDDC Demo |The Multi Edge SDDC feature in VMware Cloud on AWS empowers customers to scale their edge resources and redirect traffic with surgical precision. This demonstration reviews this capability and walks through the steps to deploy new edges. | https://youtu.be/5XStlDORqZk
Micro-segmentation of Horizon Cloud on Azure Desktops using NSX Cloud. | In this demo, learn how VMware NSX Cloud can be deployed to micro-segment virtual desktops that are deployed by VMware’s Horizon Cloud on Azure. The NSX micro-segmentation policy can control traffic between desktops within Azure VNET as well as traffic destined to on-prem. | https://youtu.be/FlTtflqZYo4
VMware NSX Cloud Demo: Single Micro-Segmentation Policy across Hybrid Cloud  |Learn how VMware NSX Cloud can help extend your security policies from on-prem to AWS and Azure. You will see how Security policies are defined based on Application requirements and are agnostic to the Cloud in which they are running in. | https://youtu.be/RsGQfpagHNQ

How to Segment Your Data Center Using VMware NSX and vSphere 7 |Easily achieve data center segmentation with a few simple steps without changing any of the underlying physical network configurations with VMware NSX and vSphere 7. This step by step tutorial will allow you to achieve your goals of application and environment segmentation to prevent lateral movement in the data center | https://youtu.be/eFYXaejriIE
Network segmentation without networking changes or hairpinning  | Using the NSX Service-defined firewall, organizations can gain visibility into traffic and easily create network segmentation by defining them entirely in software — no need to change your network or hairpin traffic by deploying discrete appliances. This demo covers a phased approach enabling customers to quickly implement zone-based segmentation – for example between development and production – and then gradually deepen their security with application isolation, micro-segmentation and IDS/IPS over time. | https://youtu.be/1s00ZbsNXgA
VMware NSX-T Identity Firewall for VDI and RDSH | The NSX Service-Defined Firewall enables user-based or identity firewalling (IDFW). With IDFW, customers can create firewall rules based on active directory user groups to provide granular per-user access to applications. In this demo, we walk through a realistic scenario, and cover the configuration steps to implement user-based application-access policies. | https://youtu.be/94HSHjKqgxo
Security Field Day: Operationalizing East – West Security at Scale with NSX Firewall |VMware’s software-defined firewalling approach allows enterprises to easily operationalizing East-West security at scale and ensure threats are not able to spread laterally through the network. Enterprises can now buy and deploy VMware NSX Firewall as a standalone security product. No longer do you need to be an existing NSX customer to take advantage of our innovative software-based approach. There are no more excuses for why you can’t modernize your security strategy today. | https://youtu.be/4cyrBb5cle0
Security Field Day: Segmentation Made Easy: A Practical Demo | This session will walk you through a real-world example of how you can secure VMware vSphere workloads with NSX Firewall. This allows you to implement segmentation in your network with just a few simple steps, in a matter of minutes, and without making any changes to your existing environment. Don’t believe us? Watch the demo and finally achieve your goal of segmenting applications and prevent lateral movement within the data center. | https://youtu.be/gkg0vrWXCTg
Security Field Day: Level Up Threat Prevention Inside the Data Center | With the acquisition of Lastline, VMware further extended its capabilities for NSX Firewall to deliver VMware NSX Advanced Threat Prevention (ATP). This solution includes capabilities consisting of VMware NSX Distributed IDS/IPS and Network Sandboxing and Network Traffic Analysis (NTA/NDR). NSX Advanced Threat Prevention allows security teams to stop the spread of attacks that breach the perimeter. The IDS/IPS can detect network threats by combining industry-leading signature sets and protocol decoders, the network sandbox provides complete malware analysis of artifacts traversing your data center and network traffic analysis detects lateral threats and anomalies in the traffic flow between hops. | https://youtu.be/UWvbS1E2r9I
